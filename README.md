# My Personal Project

## An ordered system for bubble tea shop

The application empowers employees to **manage orders** and **oversee related tasks** within a bubble tea shop. 
My passion for bubble tea inspired this initiative, as I believe such an application *streamlines operations* 
and enhances *user experience*.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add drinks to an order and specifying their types and desired customization.
- As a user, I want to be able to display all the drinks in an order with their types and desired customizations after the order is added.
- As a user, I want to be able to add toppings to drinks after I add them to an order.
- As a user, I want to be able to display the toppings I added after I add drinks.
- As a user, when I close the application, I want to be able to save the orders to files.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my previous orders from files.
